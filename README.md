# Social Network Analyser


This is the 5th course of a 5 course specialization in 'Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond' Course
taken on Coursera which is taught by UC San Diego. After completing the first 4 courses and having a great experience with them,
I had to continue and take the final course. This course is like the 'icing on the cake' as I get to apply all the concepts I've 
learnt and get the experience of building a large project. This course has very little code and most of it has to be implemented 
and designed by me which makes it even more intersting and challenging!


Social network data is all around us, and is easily represented as a graph. Consider your friend network on Facebook,
each person can be represented as a node in the graph, and each friendship connection can be represented as an undirected
edge containing the people involved in the friendship.  Twitter can be represented similarly, but with directed edges since
following someone is a one-way relationship (you can follow someone without them following you back).

Using this graph abstraction, we can answer many interesting questions about the data underlying the graph.
For example, we can automatically discover communities in a social network; we can recommend that people connect as friends
based on the structure of their mutual acquaintances in the graph; we can figure out who the “influencers” are; and,
we can look at how information might travel within and across groups.

In this capstone project, I will explore some of these issues and come up with effective solutions.
